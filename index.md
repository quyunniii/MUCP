### About
Downtown Yonge is an iconic street in Toronto that has played a central role in the city's cultural landscape, transportation network, and economic development. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted its urban life and local community endurance, revealing existing infrastructural and societal issues that require immediate attention. This project aims to reimagine Downtown Yonge by proposing solutions to enhance its livability and sustainability in the wake of the pandemic.

### Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted Downtown Yonge as a main street in Toronto, with the existing civic infrastructure not reflecting the transformative demands of the changing street. This has resulted in a lack of social, physical, cultural, and economic resilience, highlighting the need for intervention to support the vitality of the street in the long term. Therefore, our project aims to closely study how Downtown Yonge has been impacted by the pandemic, evaluate the existing state of civic infrastructure, and identify interventions that can build resilience and support the recovery of the main street post-pandemic while promoting equity and vitality.

### Methods
To develop our design interventions for Downtown Yonge, we used a mixed-methods research approach that included both preliminary and primary research to understand the needs and challenges of the area. This involved interviewing key stakeholders and conducting corridor and intersection observations to investigate traffic, street characteristics, business types, and storefront vacancies. We also conducted secondary research that analyzed previous pedestrianization case studies, investment policies, and mobility data. Based on these findings, we designed initial interventions that were evaluated through feedback from stakeholders and further analysis of similar case studies. We refined our interventions based on these insights to better address the needs and challenges of Downtown Yonge.
