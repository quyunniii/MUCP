### About
> This project is my senior year Multidisciplinary Urban Capstone Design Course offered by University of Toronto, where I worked in a group of 4 students from different disciplines. 
> Downtown Yonge is an iconic street in Toronto that has played a central role in the city's cultural landscape, transportation network, and economic development. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted its urban life and local community endurance, revealing existing infrastructural and societal issues that require immediate attention. This project aims to reimagine Downtown Yonge by proposing solutions to enhance its livability and sustainability in the wake of the pandemic.
